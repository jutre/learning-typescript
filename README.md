# Learning Typescript
### About this repository
This repository contains code created while learning Typescript. Typescript was added to an existing React app which was created to learn Redux. The original code was in one of it's early versions, it has few features - a single page application that displays book list, an ability to create, update, delete book. Redux Toolkit is used, books slice have some simple types on reducers. Some more complex types, including union types constructed of primitives, types representing React nodes are used in src/utils/FormBulder.tsx component.
